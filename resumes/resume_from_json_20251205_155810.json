          "responsibilities": [
            "Transferred data from various source systems using Informatica PowerCenter, creating ETL mappings that extracted customer records, sales transactions, and inventory data from Oracle and SQL Server databases into Hadoop HDFS storage.",
            "Loaded enterprise data warehouse tables using Sqoop commands, moving large volumes of structured data between relational databases and Hadoop ecosystem, scheduling incremental loads during off-peak hours to minimize impact on production systems.",
            "Transformed raw data files using Hive queries, cleaning inconsistent formats, handling null values, and standardizing date fields across datasets before loading into analytical data marts for business intelligence reporting.",
            "Wrote shell scripts for workflow automation, scheduling ETL jobs through cron and monitoring log files to detect failures, learning Linux command-line tools through trial-and-error while working with senior engineers on pipeline designs.",
            "Validated data quality after ETL execution, running SQL queries to compare record counts and checksums between source and target systems, identifying discrepancies that required investigation during troubleshooting sessions with team members.",
            "Joined project meetings with business analysts, taking notes on new reporting requirements and translating functional specifications into technical ETL designs under guidance from lead developers on the analytics platform team.",
            "Fixed production ETL failures during on-call support, analyzing Informatica session logs and Hadoop job traces to identify root causes like network timeouts or schema mismatches before implementing corrections.",
            "Practiced version control using SVN for Informatica XML exports, learning to manage code branches and coordinate changes with other data engineers working on shared ETL workflows in the enterprise data warehouse project."
